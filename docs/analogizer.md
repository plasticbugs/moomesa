# The Analogizer

[Analogizer](https://github.com/RndMnkIII/Analogizer) is RndMnkIII's adapter
for the Pocket's cartridge slot. It gives analog video out of a VGA connector
(RGBS, RGsB, YPbPr, Y/C, and a scandoubled RGBHV) and takes native controllers
through SNAC adapters. Its wiki is the authority on the adapter itself:
[specifications](https://github.com/RndMnkIII/Analogizer/wiki/Analogizer-Specifications),
[how to configure it](https://github.com/RndMnkIII/Analogizer/wiki/Supported-Cores-and-How-to-Configure-Them).

This page covers what this core does with it, for the person using it and for
whoever changes the core next.

## For the player

**Settings are in the core's own menu**, under the game's other options,
like RndMnkIII's own "Pocket Menu" Analogizer cores (the wiki's list calls the
other kind, which reads a shared `analogizer.bin`, "Analogizer File"; this core
does not read that file). The Pocket remembers them for this core.

| entry | options |
|---|---|
| Analogizer | Off (the default), On, On, Pocket off (the picture goes to the CRT only) |
| Analogizer Video | RGBS, RGsB, YPbPr, Y/C NTSC, Y/C PAL, Scandoubler, Scandoubler 25% / 50% / 75%, Scandoubler HQ2x |
| SNAC Adapter | None, DB15, NES, SNES, PCE 2-button, PCE 6-button, PCE Multitap, DB15 Fast, SNES A,B<->X,Y, PSX Digital, PSX Digital Fast, PSX Analog, PSX Analog Fast |
| SNAC Assignment | the six below |

With **Analogizer** off the core behaves exactly as it did without Analogizer
support. The adapter itself is set up as its wiki's
[How to use it](https://github.com/RndMnkIII/Analogizer/wiki/How-to-use-it%3F)
says: SNAC switch in position A, 5 V into its USB-C port, the SCART cable's
audio jack in the Pocket's headphone socket.

**Video.** The core sends the board's own signal: 384 × 224 visible, 15.625
kHz lines, 59.19 Hz, the timing a 15 kHz arcade monitor or a PVM expects.

| mode | SOG switch | notes |
|---|---|---|
| RGBS | off | VGA-to-SCART or VGA-to-BNC |
| RGsB | on | R2/R3 adapters only |
| YPbPr | on | R2/R3 adapters only |
| Y/C NTSC, Y/C PAL | off | needs an active Y/C adapter on the VGA port |
| SC 0% / 25% / 50% / 75% / HQ2x | off | scandoubled for a VGA monitor: 31.25 kHz |

"On, Pocket off" turns the Pocket's own picture black while the CRT keeps
it.

**Controllers.** SNAC pads (DB15, NES, SNES, PC Engine 2/6-button and
multitap, PlayStation) replace the Pocket's controls according to the
**SNAC Assignment** chosen in the menu:

| assignment | player 1 | player 2 | player 3 | player 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SNAC P1 → Pocket P1 | SNAC 1 | the Pocket's own controls | dock 3 | dock 4 |
| SNAC P1 → Pocket P2 | Pocket | SNAC 1 | dock 3 | dock 4 |
| SNAC P1,P2 → P1,P2 | SNAC 1 | SNAC 2 | dock 3 | dock 4 |
| SNAC P1,P2 → P2,P1 | SNAC 2 | SNAC 1 | dock 3 | dock 4 |
| SNAC P1,P2 → P3,P4 | Pocket | dock 2 | SNAC 1 | SNAC 2 |
| SNAC P1-P4 → P1-P4 | SNAC 1 | SNAC 2 | SNAC 3 | SNAC 4 |

Moo Mesa is a four-player board, so the last two rows are useful here. Four
SNAC players need the PC Engine multitap. The buttons map as they do on the
Pocket: B or X shoots, A or Y jumps, select is coin, start is start. A
PlayStation pad in analog mode steers with its left stick.

**Cart power is on for everyone.** `core.json` declares the cartridge adapter,
so the Pocket powers the slot whether or not an Analogizer is in it. Do not
leave a game cartridge in the slot while this core runs.

**Not verified on hardware by this core's maintainer**, who has no Analogizer
or CRT. What has been checked is listed under *What was measured* below. Send
problems with the adapter itself to the Analogizer project.

## For the developer

### The pieces

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `target/pocket/analogizer/` | RndMnkIII's `openFPGA_Pocket_Analogizer` and what it instantiates, **verbatim** (modules/VENDOR.md has the commit). Its `analogizer.qip` is ours: only what is used. |
| `target/pocket/pocket_analogizer.sv` | the wrapper: clock hand-over, Y/C constants, SNAC → controller words. Core-agnostic; the same file in the template. |
| `target/pocket/core_top.sv` | `USE_ANALOGIZER`, the instance (after the bring-up panel), `key1..key4` in place of `cont1..4_key`, the bridge read at `0xF7xxxxxx`, the Pocket-screen blank, and the cart pins' idle levels when it is off. |
| `core_pll` `outclk_4` | the Analogizer's 48 MHz, `clk_sys / 2` in phase; in the SDC's PLL group. |
| `pkg/.../interact.json` | the four entries above, ids 70–73, each a masked field of the word at `0xF7000000`. The enable and the Pocket-screen blank share one entry to keep the menu inside the 14 entries any installed core has (`tools/check_json.py`) |
| `pkg/.../core.json` | `"cartridge_adapter": 0` (powers the slot) |
| `sim/run_analogizer.sh` | the bench (below) |
| `tools/check_json.py` | fails if an entry writes outside its mask, none sets the enable, a data slot also writes `0xF7000000`, or the slot is not powered |

### The settings word

One 32-bit word at `0xF7000000`, the layout RndMnkIII's adapter module (1.4)
decodes. Each menu entry is a list with a mask that keeps every bit but its
own field (or fields), so the four entries share the word:

| bits | field | values |
|---|---|---|
| 4:0 | SNAC type | 0 none, 1 DB15, 2 NES, 3 SNES, 4 PCE 2-button, 5 PCE 6-button, 6 PCE multitap, 9 DB15 fast, 0xB SNES A/B↔X/Y, 0xC–0xF PS/2 keyboard (+ pad; not offered, the game has no use for it), 0x10/0x11 PSX digital (125/250 kHz), 0x12/0x13 PSX analog. 16 and up select the adapter's B wiring. |
| 5 | enable | 0: the port stays idle and nothing else applies |
| 9:6 | SNAC assignment | 0–5 as in the table above |
| 13:10 | video | 0 RGBS, 1 RGsB, 2 YPbPr, 3 Y/C NTSC, 4 Y/C PAL, 5–9 scandoubler 0/25/50/75%/HQ2x |
| 14 | blank the Pocket screen | |
| 15 | OSD on the Analogizer output | not used by this core; no menu entry |

**Read-back.** The word is written as a number (the adapter module is told
`bridge_endian_little = 1`, so it does not byte-swap it as it would a file),
and `pocket_analogizer` keeps its own copy to read back, combinationally.
The Pocket's bridge (`io_bridge_peripheral.sv`) samples read data four clocks
after it presents the address and pulses `bridge_rd` only afterwards; the
adapter module updates its read-back on that pulse, so it would hand back
the *previous* read's value. If the firmware merges a masked entry by
reading the word, that stale value would wipe the other fields: in the
bench, choosing a video mode turned the Analogizer off. RndMnkIII's menu
cores (Gauntlet) read the word back the same way, from a register.

**The file scheme, not used here.** The adapter module 1.4 was written for
`analogizer.bin`, a file Pupdate and AnalogizerConfigurator write to
`/Assets/analogizer/common/`, loaded through a data slot at the same address.
It needs a data slot naming the file, a second platform id `analogizer`
that the slot's parameters point at, and the file on the card before the
adapter does anything. A player who has never heard of the file has an
Analogizer that stays dark, so this core uses the menu. A data slot at
`0xF7000000` would load the file over the menu's word; `tools/check_json.py`
refuses one.

### Clocks

`openFPGA_Pocket_Analogizer` runs its logic on `i_clk`, puts `video_clk` on the
cartridge pin that clocks the ADV7123, and assumes that is `i_clk` too. The
scandoubler halves the pixel period, so the clock has to be at least four
times the dot rate. The shipped Analogizer cores use 42.95–48 MHz. This core's
system clock is 96 MHz, which is more than the cart's level translators have
been asked to pass, so the PLL's spare output gives 48 MHz, in phase with
`clk_sys`. `pocket_analogizer` takes each pixel two system clocks after the dot
enable (`PIX_LAG`) into a holding register and hands it over with a toggle.
The Analogizer side picks it up two or three of its clocks later, well inside
the 12-clock dot.

The Y/C encoder's subcarrier step and colour-burst window are computed in
integers from `CLK_HZ`. The reals used elsewhere lose the bits past 32 in some
tools, and MSX2's hand-typed NTSC step is a few counts off.

### Using SNAC in the game's inputs

`pocket_analogizer` outputs `key1..key4`, the Pocket's controller words with
SNAC pads put in place by the assignment. SNAC's bit order is the Pocket's
(0 up, 1 down, 2 left, 3 right, 4 A, 5 B, 6 X, 7 Y, 8 L1, 9 R1, … 14 select,
15 start). They feed the `gamepad` helper and the direct player-3/4 reads in
place of `cont1..4_key`, so the game's input logic did not change.

### What was measured

- `sim/run_analogizer.sh`: the wrapper and the vendored module at this core's
  raster and clocks, read at the cartridge pins as the DAC reads them.
  - With the menu at its defaults, every pin sits as on a core without the
    adapter, and the controller words pass through.
  - Every option of every Analogizer entry in the package's `interact.json`
    (32), set as the firmware sets a masked entry, read back the word as the
    bridge samples it, merged and written: the word, the adapter's copy and
    the enable each followed. With the adapter's own read-back in place of
    the wrapper's, the same run fails at the second entry.
  - RGBS: all 86,016 visible dots of a frame reach the DAC pins, in raster
    order, as their top six bits per channel, with 0 differing. Csync is one
    40-dot pulse a line.
  - Scandoubler: 528 lines per frame at 1536 clocks, half the core's 3072.
  - YPbPr and Y/C NTSC/PAL: no unknown on any pin for a frame.
  - All six SNAC assignments, the analog stick, and type "none" map as
    tabled.
  - The blank bit, and enable off again returning the port to idle.
- `sim/lint.sh`: the wrapper lints clean. The vendored files' warnings are
  dropped by path; their errors are not.
- Quartus 18.1: compiles, every SDC constraint applied, no negative slack
  at any corner (worst setup +0.354 ns slow 0C, worst hold +0.069 ns fast
  0C, in the tile line buffer; SDRAM capture is not among the 20 worst hold
  paths). With the menu settings the Analogizer costs 1,484 ALMs
  (9,089 → 10,573, 57%), 13 RAM blocks (265 → 278 of 308) and 2 DSP blocks;
  the file-settings build before it was 10,639.

**Not proven:** anything on hardware, and the SNAC serial protocols, which are
the adapter module's and are forced at its outputs in the bench rather than
driven over the pins. The Y/C and YPbPr encodings have no reference to compare
against, only a run without unknowns.

### Turning it off

Set `USE_ANALOGIZER = 0` in `core_top.sv`, remove `general[4]` from the PLL
group in the SDC (it would match nothing), and take the four menu entries
and `cartridge_adapter: 0` out of the JSON.
